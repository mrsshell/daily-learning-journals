  <p>This is a very long day. I am still challenged with getting the tools to work. I am so very grateful for the attitude of this class. The folks are truly amazing and very committed to their studies. </p>

  <p>I am still struggling to get the best view of what I am doing, but in time I will figure it out.</p>

  <p>It is going on 9:00 pm and I am going home to get some sleep.</p>

  <h2> Good bye and Good Night!</h2>
