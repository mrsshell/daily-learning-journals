Today was a great day- I had a major breakthrough on the cookie store project and how the table is identified and then created by row and filled with data cell that contain something. Then that row is tied to the named thing, and then another row is created, then filled with data, and attached to the parent, and so on and so on.
We also had a CSS styling project where we had to build a web page from an example, and fill and space it as close as possible to the original design. The was really a fun project, and I worked with another partner, named Shayne. He is also an artist, and has more experience playing with Css, it was really fun and collaborative- It was interesting to approach this from the topline of html down. I for some reason like to do everything together because I usually start out with a clear picture of what how I wan things to look and act.

Anyway it was a really fun day, and I really needed a fun day, because I went to bed after breaking my code last night and then got up in the middle of the night to research. This morning I got up , and had the idea of how I wanted to do this problem. I got to work super early- no, to code fellows super early and had to draw it on the wall. As I was drawing this I figured out why my approach wasn't working and how to do it different so that it would work! I have had help before and I really did not understand what other people were saying, and now I got this, I needed to know absolutely how to make this table recipe. So now I know that I can make a table that can display current data as it is updated and how to build a form that will take information and do something with it.
